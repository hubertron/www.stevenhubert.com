      <h1>Hello, I'm Steven Hubert</h1>

      <p>I am a seasoned product design and UX leader with a proven track record of delivering world-class products.</p>

      <p>Over the course of 18 years, I have honed my skills in the digital domain, working with leading ski resorts, non-profits, and both B2C and B2B businesses. My work has been widely recognized and praised by customers and industry peers alike.</p>

      <p>Most recently, I have been a key player in building the Ikon Pass at Alterra Mountain Company, as well as developing industry-leading design systems for top ski resorts across North America. Prior to that, I led the product management practice for multiple leading agencies, including CP+B, Grey, Domani Studios, and J. Walter Thompson, earning numerous awards at prestigious events such as Cannes, SXSW, and The FWA.</p>

      <p>As a product design and UX leader, I bring a unique blend of creativity, strategic thinking, and technical expertise to every project I undertake. I am currently seeking my next big challenge and am confident that my skills and experience can add value to your organization. If you have a project that requires a dynamic and results-driven product design and UX leader, I would love to have a conversation.
