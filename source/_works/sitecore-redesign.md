excerpt: "Alterra Mountain Company owns and operates 15 ski resorts. It is Alterra's goal to allow them to be unique and free to market their brand as they see fit. My task was to design a system and CMS to allow for flexibility while allowing reuse of products."

The homepage of Alterra's ski resorts serve as the "front door" to the brand so when designing a system we needed to make sure the brand could come through. One way to excel at this is via background video. It allows a newly arriving guest to experience unique mountain moments and really takes in what a vacation at Alterra's resorts entails.

Deer Valley excel's here at letting the guest experience the brand with beautiful landscape while also highlighting the ever important booking widget always overlaying the video.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/714238091?h=8641c30312&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&muted=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Summer Your Way at Deer Valley"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Since Each of the 15 brands plays on this theme slightly differently and offer slightly different mountain offerings so I needed to design a framework that allows for that flexibility which you can see below.

<div style="display:flex">

  <a href="#img1"><p><img src="/images/AllResortList.jpg" alt="All Resort Homepage"></p></a>
  <figcaption>All Sites Homepages (Click to Expand)</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<a href="#" class="lightbox" id="img1">
  <span style="background-image: url('/images/AllResortList.jpg')"></span>
</a>

I also designed a backend experience to make it possible for local mountain employees without a background in technology to easily update layout and content based on their unique mountain needs.

</div>

This customization extends throughout the site allowing for the development team to ship new features without having to develop for 15 different use cases. This combination of reusability and uniqueness allows for deep customization with the costs savings realized by having a single codebase.
